## The 4Cs model

### &#8680; Connections

#### Opening (activity, 5m)

- (crisp) high five!

#### How now? (activity, 15m)

2. **How** do you train? 1 thing per sticky. Group the stickies.
3. What’s the **goal** of the training? 1 thing per sticky. Group the stickies.

### &#8680; Concepts

#### Optimise for learners (chat, 5m)

- **Positive environment**
    - Q: What does that mean? A: Friendly, Collaborative, Progress- and goal- aware. Asking questions is the sign of a good learner.
    - Q: Why? A: Greatly improves learning. Uses problem-solving part of brain.
- **The Learning cycle**
    - (re)do &rarr; feedback &rarr; reflection &rarr; repeat.
    - reflection is when the learning sticks. Link the before and after. Pair share is especially good for this because people learn by teaching too.
- **Primacy-Recency Principle**

#### X is better than Y (activity, 5m)
