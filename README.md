## The 4Cs model: helping learners learn

### &#8680; Connections

#### Opening (activity, 5m)

1. Share your favorite thing about training with every other person in the room
- (crisp) high five!

#### How now? (activity, 15m)

1. **What** do you train?
    - 1 thing per sticky. Group the stickies.
2. **How** do you train?
    - 1 thing per sticky. Group the stickies.
3. What’s the **goal** of the training?
    - 1 thing per sticky. Group the stickies.

### &#8680; Concepts

#### Optimise for learners (chat, 5m)

- **Positive environment**
    - Q: What does that mean?
    - A: Friendly, Collaborative, Progress- and goal- aware.
        - Asking questions is the sign of a good learner. Give QQ example.
    - Q: Why?
    - A: Greatly improves learning. Uses problem-solving part of brain.
        - Hands on your head for neocortex (relaxed, open, faster learning), reptilian (stressed, slow or stopped learning).
- **The Learning cycle**
    - (re)do &rarr; feedback &rarr; reflection &rarr; repeat.
    - reflection is when the learning sticks. Link the before and after. Pair share is especially good for this because people learn by teaching too.
- **Primacy-Recency Principle**
  - People remember the first thing, then the last thing, then everything else.

#### X is better than Y (activity, 10m)

- Match up the cards to complete “X is better than Y”.
- Discuss the matches.

### &#8680;  Concrete Practice

#### The 4Cs model (chat, 5m)

Training from the back of the room. Sharon Bowman. http://bowperson.com/

- **Connections** To other learners, Topic, Goal, Outcomes. High-energy (Primacy-Recency Principle).
- **Concepts** Mini-lectures, Reading material.
- **Concrete Practice** Do the thing.
- **Conclusions** Link the before and after. High-energy (Primacy-Recency Principle).

#### Lesson plan idea (activity, 15m)

- Pick your favorite from “What do you teach?”
- Show 4C training plan example
- Fill in the 4C training plan

### &#8680;  Conclusions

#### Pair share (activity, 5m)

1. **SMART goal**: one (small!) thing you will to change tomorrow.
2. fist bump
